# Metropolis Hastings Airlines
An airline company is interested in examining vaccination trends among its travelers. It ultimately wants to know what percentage of its travelers are 1) full vaccinated and boosted, 2) fully vaccinated but not boosted, 3) partially vaccinated, or 4) not vaccinated (i.e. there are K = 4 groups). The company wants to examine such vaccination trends both for domestic and international flights (i.e. J = 2 groups). They collect data from a random sample of travelers on recent flights and have compiled it in the table below:

| Vaccination Status           | Fully and Boosted | Fully but not boosted | Partially  | Unvaccinated  |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
Domestic flight travelers      | 12                | 43                    | 4          | 13            |
International flight travelers | 23                | 30                    | 2          | 11            |
